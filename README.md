# Cairn-Custom-Character-Creator
Allows users to make new compendiums based on the SRD and edit them to generate characters how they like.

### Usage
Duplicate the SRD Character Creation Tables and Character Traits, then go to settings (Cairn Custom Character Creation) and point the pointers to the duplicates respectively. From there, edit the duplicates however you like, but remember to adjust the references across all the compendiums (for instance, if you edit the Male Names, edit the reference in the duplicate for names as well to point to the new compendium holding "Male Names")

#### Warning: Do not adjust the names of any of the tables, this module works off the assumption that the table names in the new compendiums is the same as in the SRD (hence why the instructions say to duplicate them), the module will throw an error if you do not follow this instruction.
